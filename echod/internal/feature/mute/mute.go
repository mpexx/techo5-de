// Package mute is the microphone mute: the switch in Home Assistant, the button on top of the
// device, and what the ring shows while the microphones are cut.
//
// The cut is real rather than a software flag, so muted here means the microphones are
// disconnected. Home Assistant asks for a state, the button asks for the other one, and start-up
// asks for whatever was stored — they move the line differently and then want exactly the same
// things to follow, so they share settled.
