// Package setup is the device's own setup page: the few settings that are miserable to type on a
// five-inch screen, and the only way to configure a device that has no screen at all.
//
// It is off until somebody asks for it — from the device's settings screen, from Home Assistant, or
// on a Dot by holding the action button — and it turns itself off again seven minutes after the last
// request, or an hour after it was opened, whichever comes first. While it is off the path is not
// served and, with nothing else switched on, the port is not listening.
//
// Getting in is a press on the device rather than a password: a browser that asks is told to press
// the action button, the device says so too, and the press authorizes that one browser. It proves
// somebody is standing at the device, it cannot be read off a photograph, and it works on a Dot,
// which has no screen to show a code on. See docs/setup-page-design.md.
