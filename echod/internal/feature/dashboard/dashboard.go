// Package dashboard puts a Home Assistant dashboard on the screen, in one of two ways. Drawn, the
// device reads the dashboard's cards and draws them itself, in its own style: fast, and nothing else
// to run, but only the cards it knows. Streamed, a dashcast server runs a browser for it and sends the
// dashboard as pictures, and the device sends back where it was touched: every card looks exactly as
// it does in Home Assistant, at the cost of a server and a moment's wait on every tap.
//
// This package holds the settings and the stream; the display draws the page.
